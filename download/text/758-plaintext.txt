Nothing special

The food was okay, but the taste was below my expectation. Decent choices of meal and drink, but they should provide more of them. Place was nice, not too big but clean and enjoyable ambience, with outdoor seating at the back. Price was moderate like...any other food courts. It's upfront payment concept.More
