Treat your appetite

It is a kind of big food court. You can choose the indoor or outdoor area with many choices of food. You can enjoy the live music while feeding your mouth. You can also ride some attractions. The location is very close to East Coast mall.

Lots of food, all in one place.

There is a massive food court and also many eateries and restaurants lining up the road (carpark) in between.

If you are not sure where to go to eat, spend one time at Pakuwon Food Festival.

Plus you can walk further to the east Coast Center Mall where there is a hypermarket to do some grocery shopping

Notable Place to Visit in Surabaya

This place is a 80% outdoor area, and 20% indoor area. Outdoor means open air, indoor means there's a roof, but still in open space.
This place is divided into several sections: 1) the section with the roof, is full with food stalls, which mostly offer local delicacies; 2) another section is 2 rows of restaurants, with roof as well; 3) the last section is another row of food stalls that mostly sell local street snacks. This one is open air.
Beside those sections, there's also a section where kids can play. For example: train, pony riding, tandem bicycle riding, 'becak' riding, mini carousel, trampoline area, bump cars.
Why is this place worth to visit, especially for visitors?
If you really want to have a local culinary marathon, then this is a good place.
The only thing to be noted is: it becomes inconvenient if it rains, there's no air-con so it's definitely hot and humid, the parking lots are open as well.
Best prep to do is bring your umbrella!

Easy Way to Enjoy Local Food

Took family to Food Festival so they could experience a variety of Indonesian food. It was a very good decision. It's a whole street with food on both sides, end to end. We especially enjoyed the coconut ice cream, which was so good. Food prices are also quite reasonable. This is a safer option than random foodstalls along the road throughout the city.
