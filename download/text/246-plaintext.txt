Great selection of food and people.

This was a great place to visit. It was near my hotel and I went here when I was hungry. It is just good for walking around and people watching, especially at night. It is packed with people and lots of food vendors. I was having a difficult time and a vendor was trying to over charge me for some sate, and some English speaking locals stepped in to help. Mostly locals and a few people that wanted to speak with me in English. It was a very friendly place.

Only good for food hunting

Forget about this park if you want to have a serious running exercise. Not only the track is quite small but there are so many people hanging around that make you unable to pass. The only good about this park is because it is already popular, so many food stall nearby.. It is like a culinary trip along the way. The only reason people come here besides the food experience, is they expect to see people and to be seen
