Museum only

The factory processing cigarettes had stopped in Sept 2019. What you will see is a cavenous empty hall. However, there is still a video which u can view. We learnt the origins of kretek (cloves) in the cigarette. Cloves is used to relieve asthma attacks....There was a batik demo and all visitors had complimentary burger.More

Change management

Changed name & chef & menu. But some favorites food are still the same, such as, oxtail soup, soto ayam & nasi goreng. The room in the back are for smokers & the room is really smelly when u want to pass thru to the...toilet behind it. Price is moderate & taste average nothing special. But they serve coffee mix. Maybe it's good, haven't tried it yet.More

Unexpectedly interesting

Truly didn't expect such a fascinating tour and museum. Seeing the ladies working, rolling 300 cigarettes in an hour was incredible. They never stop. Really interesting other aspects of the business, including the printing of cartons, publicity etc. Expected little but found it amazing. The...coffee shop/restaurant on site, Tanamera is also superb.More

It’s great

Shows the history of how Sampoerna family became the major player in the tobacco industry. Don’t forget to join the Surabaya Heritage Track (it’s free). They are available at three occasions: 10am, 1pm, and 3pm.

House of Sampoerna(perfection)

You need to take a taxi or Grab to reach this historic site to find out the origin of cigarette making in Surabaya....it is advisable to reach at the opening time at 9am in order to make your booking for a separate free bus tour...to the historical sites in the city. Hence, you get two conducted tour for free. Within the compound is also an art museum( exhibition changes), sales gallery and a cafe for you to relax.More

An 86 year old cigarette factory

Despite my disapproval of smoking, I visited this factory and was amazed the see the dexterity of the workers making cigarettes. This factory also contains a good restaurant which serves good food and excellent coffee.
