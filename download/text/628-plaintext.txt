I was amazed how many other members in Jakarta share the same interests as me. And some of them come from Norway, too !

Discover Surabaya's Friendly Expat Community!

Hello lan sambutan — a very warm welcome to our expat community in Surabaya, Indonesia. Like any new experience, it's best to draw on the advice of those who've done it themselves. Moving to a new country is no different, and InterNations is a resource for expats in Surabaya to share their experiences, acting as a sounding board for those moving to the city. Whether you're in the process of relocating, or have already moved to Surabaya, InterNations offers invaluable resources and acts as a point of dialogue between expats. There are so many considerations when moving abroad, and as an InterNations member you'll find that all of them are addressed on our expat network, including, "what is the quality of education for international children?", "do I have to pay for healthcare?", or "which area of the city has the best nightlife?". All of these are typical questions asked by expats moving to Surabaya, and all can be answered by fellow expats with first-hand experience.

Additional Information on Expat Life in Surabaya

Surabaya is the second-largest city in Indonesia and has played a pivotal part in the country's history, having been the center of trading in the Dutch East Indies. Whether moving to Surabaya because of work or other reasons, expats will find the city a pleasantly clean environment for the most part — it has been compared to Singapore, such is the pride it takes in its appearance. Residents themselves have been known to take to the streets in cleaning teams to keep their area pristine. Days of leisure for expats in Surabaya offer a chance to take in the city's mix of historical sites and modern complexes, while the cuisine is a cross-section of traditional Indonesian fare and dishes from China, which accounts for much of the country's expat population.

InterNations: The Easiest Way to Grow Your Expat Network in Surabaya

Surabaya is known for its tropical equatorial climate and with the help of your fellow expats you'll quickly adjust and settle in to your new environment. Hobbies and areas of personal interest form part of our identity, and as part of the InterNations Surabaya Community you will be able to find and meet expats with similar tastes, an essential part of making friends and feeling at home in a new country. All we ask is you respect the opinions of other InterNations members, and that you demonstrate politeness and courtesy when interacting with other members, whether online or offline. So come along to one of our large community-wide social events or meet up with fellow members in a smaller setting by joining one of groups for different hobbies and interests. If there isn't a group open yet for your favorite hobby, feel free to start your own.

It's a really helpful site: Via InterNations, we found an international playgroup for our kids (6 and 8 years old) here in Jakarta.
