Snippets: Where and what to eat in Surabaya | Cafes and Restaurants to check out including Ayam Goreng President

Posted on December 22, 2018 by theRantingPanda in Food, Snippets

Surabaya – We all need that energy to head to Mt Bromo. I wouldn’t use the word exciting to describe the culinary scene in Surabaya, but suffice to say the cafe scene is growing for sure, or you can always fall back to the numerous restaurants in the city.

Here are some of our top picks!

Restaurants

Ayam Goreng PresidentIf you only have time for one restaurant, head to this famous local eatery for its fried chicken wings. The setting is no frills, canteen style where you place your order on a paper. My recommendation is to get there early evening as some parts of the chicken may be sold out earlier, like the chicken thigh.Address: Jl. Tidar No.22, Sawahan, Kec. Sawahan, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60251, Indonesia

Bebek SinjayRecommended by our Indonesian friends, Bebek Sinjay is the place to head to if you love your duck. With multiple outlets across Surabaya, the fried duck is the main highlight, which is very tender and flavourful. Do what the locals do (with caution of course) by having it along with the spicy sauce which comes along!
Address: Various locations across Surabaya

Warung Bu KrisAnother popular warung in Surabaya, Bu Kris specialises in its chicken meat which comes with hot sambal chilli sauce. It is a no frills setting with a mainly local crowd, which makes it a good spot if you want to have some authentic local food.
Address: Various locations across Surabaya

Nasi Cumi Pasar AtomCumi is squid and this warung specialises in their rice with squid. It is nothing fanciful, a street stall right beside the road where people order, eat and leave. I am not a fan of squid done this way, but it makes an adventurous dining option in Surabaya.
Address: Jl. Waspada No. 2-4, Bongkaran, Pabean Cantian, Bongkaran, Pabean Cantian, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60161, Indonesia

Sate klopo ondomohen SurabayaA local satay joint where you can watch the workers grill the satay at the entrance, I headed here with my Indonesian friends and we ordered a mix of chicken and beef meats. It isn’t mind blowing for me, but is very popular among the locals.
Address: Jl. Walikota Mustajab No.36, Ketabang, Genteng, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60272, Indonesia

Cafes

Monopole Coffee LabFor cafes, Monopole Coffee Lab boasts a huge space for some decent coffee in Surabaya. The brand is quite well-known, and has an Instagram-worthy space where you can put your artistic flair to play. The food menu is quite varied as well, making it an ideal spot for brunch.
Address: Jl. Raya Darmo Permai I No.38, Pradahkalikendal, Dukuh Pakis, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60189, Indonesia

Thirty Three Brew
Quite a cafe with a character, Thirty Three Brew exudes a more indie vibe as compared to Monopole. The cups are pretty, people are laidback and it also specialises in cold brew coffee.
Address: Jl. Opak No.45, Darmo, Wonokromo, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60241, Indonesia

Redback Specialty Coffee
Located in a golf club, you would think that Redback Specialty Coffee would be deserted but the opposite is true. It was packed on a weekend I visited. The ambience here is relatively relaxed, as it overlooks the golf course with an outdoor seating area as well. The coffee is not too bad, and there are plenty of pastries and croissants to go along.
Addresss: Jl. Raya Golf Graha Famili Blok K, Pradahkalikendal, Dukuh Pakis, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60227, Indonesia

Caturra EspressoAnother hipster cafe, I like Caturra Espresso for its natural light, which really makes a difference in brightening the mood. Expect a good variety of coffee from flat white to cold brew, along with a western food menu from light snacks to mains. There is also an emphasis on using natural ingredients.
Address: Jl. Anjasmoro No.32, Sawahan, Kec. Sawahan, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60251, Indonesia
