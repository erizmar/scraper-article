Voting here easy; overseas? It’s an adventure

Friday

Nov 6, 2020 at 8:45 AM

Earlier in October, my 21-year-old son, Harrison, and I voted in the 2020 election. It was an extremely easy process. We went to Monroe City Hall, picked up our absentee ballots and went home. After some discussion on “how to do this” — this was Harrison’s first time to vote — we filled out our ballots. The next day, I returned our sealed and signed ballots to Monroe City Hall.

Voting was vastly different as a U.S. citizen living in Southeast Asia. Our family moved to the island of Singapore in 1994 when my former husband accepted work in the furniture industry. Voting in the 1996 election meant taking a short taxi ride to the U.S. Embassy, completing our absentee ballots and then turning them back into the Embassy. It wasn’t so bad.

Voting in the 2000 elections in Indonesia was a different story altogether. We then lived in Semarang, Central Java, one of the many islands that formed the nation of Indonesia. Again, we would have to vote at either the U.S. embassy in Jakarta, or the U.S. Consulate in Surabaya. We were almost equidistant from either facility. It was a 24-hour car drive OR a 12-hour train trip. With our then 5-year-old daughter, Kara, in tow, we decided on the 12-hour train trip to Surabaya.

Trains in Indonesia were definitely NOT like Amtrak. The rail system in Java had been built during the Dutch colonial era, which ended after World War II. And it had not been updated since! Sitting in the dusty train car, windows open to try to alleviate the tropical heat, we ate our lunch and snacks we brought with us. Kara dozed, leaning against me, lulled to sleep by the rocking of the train car. Then it started to rain. Up go the windows, and I soon felt like I was in a steamy oven.

Late in the evening, we arrived at Surabaya. By then the rain had flooded most of the train station. We waited until it was our turn to leave the train car, and made a short leap from the train car exit to the station platform. My former husband went first, then we passed Kara between us. Finally, with the help of the train conductor, I made my own “stretch” over the flowing water between the conductor and my former spouse. We suddenly heard cheers — the remaining Indonesians watching us celebrated our train departure!

The next morning, we went to the U.S. Consulate to vote. Basking in the cool air conditioning, we filled out our ballot and then spent a fun day in Surabaya. Early the next morning, we took a returning train to Semarang. No rain (yeah) but again a long warm trip home.

Why would we take such pains to vote? For me, it was witnessing in 1999 the first free elections in Indonesia in over 30 years. Suharto, the Indonesian dictator who had ruled this country for so long, was overthrown in 1998. By June 1999, Indonesia had organized its election system. Election Day was a public holiday so that everyone could get to the polls. People registered and then were able to vote. I saw people laughing and singing as they marched through the streets. Voters waved their right index finger blacken with indelible ink to show that they had exercised their right of suffrage — and to prevent possible fraud of duplicate voters.

If Indonesians, who had suffered so much from a dictator, could celebrate voting in free and fair elections, who was I to complain about a long train ride to exercise my own right to vote?

We have a long and changing history of voting. At first it was only white men of property who were allowed the franchise. This right to vote has been extended now to all U.S. citizens regardless of gender, economic status and race. It is a right that other countries envy. Don’t take our election process for granted.
