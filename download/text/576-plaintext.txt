Review of Surabaya on FootReviewed March 12, 2017 via mobile

Two thumbs up for this !

We did a Surabaya walking tour where we visited a local Kampung - to see how some people still live, despite being surrounded by crowded roads and noisy traffic. Was introduced to the locals living there and had first hand experience trying to imagine what it is like to live there. Also an eye opener to see the various environmental saving initiatives like recycling waste.

Also visited the Sampoerna museum and also went to the Arab quarters and traditional markets.

In the evening we had the evening food tour. Where we were exposed to the food which the locals eat.

Without this tour, we would never have ventured so far out and tried so many different kinds of food.

Thank you to our guide Denny for bringing us around.
