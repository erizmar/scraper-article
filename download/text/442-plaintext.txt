In an era where caf√©s and stores are being set up with a touch of aesthetic, it is most certainly apt to say ‚Äúcheese‚Äù. Good thing, Surabaya is now overflowing with caf√© choices that mostly step their interior game up to provide the next Instaworthy spot. If you‚Äôre looking for content over some decent food, here are the most Instagrammable caf√© in the city, all primed and ready for your feed.

1. Belly Buddy

Whether you‚Äôre here to catch the sun over Surabaya‚Äôs blue sky or enjoy the lively atmosphere after dark, take the lift up to the rooftop and be greeted by the spacious beer garden named Belly Buddy. The semi-outdoor area offers a Mediterranean style environment smartened by a set of curved lamps, while the indoor area is dazzled by an attractive colorful mural on the wall. At night, Belly Buddy is magically lit with fairy lights that stand rebelliously against the dark. Live music will also take the deck to set the mood on selected nights. So perch for a while and enjoy the vibrant moment as they serve beer in bottle and tower. Another plus point, they also provide a wide variety of snacks and foods.

Rooftop, Jl. Raya Ngagel No. 209Ib, Ngagel, Wonokromo, Surabaya

2. Kudos Caf√©

Stand stall on Pakuwon Square complex, this 3-story caf√© carrying Scandinavian style, as we recognize it today, tend to boast and emphasize light with a neutral-earthy tone color palette, hanging dried flowers and herbs, and potted plants as well. The caf√© itself is flooded with natural light due to its floor-to-ceiling windows, while minimalist designed bookshelves and white-tone walls provide ample opportunities for a clean and sleek shot for Instagram. Food option is ranging from all-day breakfast, pizza, pasta, and consistently good coffee.

3. Mama Noi

Mama Noi‚Äôs verdant setting is perfect for any photo, and the restaurant features a wide outdoor lawn space for you to take your perfect snap. The joint‚Äôs exterior is extremely Instaworthy with its impressive colorful window shutters for its fa√ßade. Inside, homey vintage interior and an eye-catching greenery view help create a warm ambiance of peace. It‚Äôs the place in Surabaya to offer a wide variety of Thai-inspired comfort food such as Pad Thai, Tom Yum Goong, Kwetiau Kai, Beef Green Curry, Tom Kha Kai with Rice, and their unique Toast Stick.

4. Noach Caf√© and Bistro

Taking the place strategically on Pregolan street, Noach Caf√© and Bistro is a gorgeous concept that‚Äôs elegant and lush collide all at once. It takes its cue from a modern version of tropical chic, setting its space with giant birdcage complementing the wood details, sophisticated furniture, and lush walls. The semi-outdoor area, where you can catch the light was designed to look like a glasshouse. Beckoning the greenery indoor and a giant birdcage seat are sure the scene-stealer here. We‚Äôd imagine diners would endlessly snap photos and flock to for every occasion.

Jl. Pregolan No. 4, Tegalsari, Surabaya

5. ONNI House

Similar to their sister in Jakarta, ONNI House is a caf√© beautifully-structured together with a florist and home living concept stores all in the same place. The caf√© is decorated with dried flowers, ivy, and ferns dangling from its ceiling plus colorful flower in pots and vases on the shelves. The dining area gives a warm, homey, and inviting space adorned with a brick wall, dried flowers, and fresh greenery. It‚Äôs the faultless place to sit back, chill out, and perfect-fit for every sweet occasion arranged. As the season comes and goes, you may all notice the flower arrangement will become different from a seasoned-theme flower from the florist, which doubles up as good photogenic spots.

Fort Kedung Cowek is a collection of coastal artillery batteries (kustbatterij) that function as a fortress and defense system for the coast and the Madura Strait.  The fortification system of this fort is a modern one.  The artillery batteries are positioned separately in a longitudinal formation along the coast.  Each battery of the cannon has a certain firing range.  So that other cannons have an auxiliary firing range between cannons.

This fort was once a warehouse for bullets and at least this fort is still fortunate because it is relatively intact, unlike Prins Hendrik Fortress which was demolished in 1895. The status of cultural heritage for this fort is also being pursued by historical activists of the city of Surabaya.
