Beware if you need Halal Food in Food Court

I was so surprise when I ate in Food Court in Galaxi Mall. As Surabaya is the 2nd largest city in Indonesia with high population moslem, the mall officer should separates plates, spoon, glasses for Halal & Non Halal Food as same as Food Court in Singapore. I urge all moslem do not eat in the Food Court as long as they can not separate the food utensils

Jalan-jalan at GM

Nice, clean, bright, safe and complete mall in Surabaya. I like this mall more than other malls in Surabaya because of the above reason.
The food variety at the food court is good, clean with reasonable price. Likewise the waiters are friendly and hardworking.
