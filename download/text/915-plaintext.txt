Secret of the iron plate

With its Japanese-patented unique design, the iron plate plays a key part in Pepper Lunch’s successful formula. Using a special electromagnetic cooker, the iron plate will heat up to 260 ̊C in 70 seconds. It will stay hot at approximately 80 ̊C for more than 20 minutes. The iron plate also keeps the other dishes in the meal warm, with a freshly-cooked taste for longer periods time. Better yet, you can visit our regular Pepper Lunch establishments, located in the most strategic hang-out places around the country, or try Pepper Lunch Express, a swifter way to experience our meal, at the best food courts around Indonesia. With our two special sauces to add to the meals of your choosing, we are more than certain you’ll be hooked on Pepper Lunch right away!

THE IRON PLATE WILL HEAT UP TO 260°C. MEAT THAT IS GRILLED AT THIS TEMPERATURE RANGE REMAINS TENDER AND JUICY.
