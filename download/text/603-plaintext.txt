Apart from being the capital of east Java province in Indonesia, Surabaya is also known as the “City of Heroes”, and National Heroes’ Day, or Hari Pahlawan, is celebrated every 10th of November to commemorate the heroic soldiers who died in the 1945 Battle of Surabaya against the Dutch.

There’s so much to see and do, and that’s why Agoda, one of the world’s fastest growing online travel agency (OTA), maps out some of the historic spots you should visit to celebrate this Heroes’ Day. Whether you decide to walk, rent a bicycle, or travel in a taxi, it is easy to get around in Surabaya.

- Understand the history of the battle at Tugu Pahlawan

Start your journey by honoring the heroes at Tugu Pahlawan, or Heroes Monument, and reliving the Battle of Surabaya at 10 November Museum nearby.

To complete the history adventure, spend the night at Hotel Majapahit Surabaya, formerly known as Yamato Hotel, where enraged Indonesian youths tore down the Dutch flag, replacing it with an Indonesian flag. Located in the middle of the city, the hotel played a significant part in the lead-up to the Battle of Surabaya.

- Explore the colonial influence in the city

Rejuvenate at the Bumi Surabaya City Resort, where you can easily continue the historic exploration from the city center. Take in the sights of the old colonial city, where Dutch colonial style architecture and facades can still be found along the streets.

Also, stop by the Bambu Runcing Monument in the heart of city. Bambu Runcing (which literally means ‘sharp bamboo’), was used as a weapon by the young people of Surabaya during the battle. The monument, which resembles five bamboo, was built in memory of these people.

- Soak up the metropolitan ambience

If you’re tired from exploring historic sites, see how Surabaya has changed since its independence struggle. Venture down the main streets of Basuki Rahmat, Mayjen Sungkono, and HR Muhammad, which were named after three famous national military heroes, and venture into one of the malls for a meal or quick retail break.

Complete the metropolitan experience at The Alimar Premier in Surabaya, which boasts sleek, avant-garde design inside and out.

- End the day with a riverside sunset stroll

Brantas Riverside runs in the middle of Surabaya, from Jembatan Merah to Gunungsari area. Jembatan Merah or translated as Red Bridge, was where one of the most savage fights of the Surabaya Battle took place. The bridge earned its name from the amount of blood shed during that period.

For the best night city experience, stay at TS Suites Surabaya located in Surabaya Town Square complex, where you will find plenty of options for dining and entertainment, including family karaoke outlets and full-serviced spas.
