Still the best mall in Surabaya

Review of Galaxy MallReviewed 8 October 2017 via mobile

As the finest mall in eastern of Surabaya, I recommend Galaxy Mall to visit with family or friends while around the city.
Still the best mall to visit along with Ciputra World Mall in Surabaya.
Tunjungan Plaza is the biggest mall in Surabaya but less comfortable and friendly.

Date of experience: October 2017

College student's favorite hangout place

Galaxy mall is surrounded by top colleges at Surabaya such as Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember and Airlangga University. Of course it would be the first choice for college student to hangout. It has cinema and plenty choices of food based on your budget. Just be careful (especially for moslem visitor) because it have many non-halal foods too.

Date of experience: January 2017

My Favourite Mall in Surabaya

This mall is my favourite mall in Surabaya, always go there when I'm in the city. It's family friendly (there are family facilities such as nursing room, lifts), and it's also a one-stop shop, as there is a supermarket (Ranch Market), 2 department stores (Centro in the old one, and Sogo in the new one), and a great food court which has the local delights. Must visit for a good shopping experience when you are in Surabaya.

Growth Together

One of busy mall at East Surabaya. With concept of family mall, you can see famous tenant, department store, hangout corner and playground. It has Mal Galaxy and Galaxy Mall Extension but it merged and became Galaxy Mall, that was quite a trivia :)
Park your car inside the building. Motor parking across the mall building. Don't worry because its easy to cross the street.

Worth to visit

Worth to visit if you live or stay around this place. If you're in the city center, Tunjungan Plaza is the better choice. If you're in West Surabaya, Pakuwon Mall is the answer.

Galaxy, Tunjungan, and Pakuwon are the leading and the largest shopping center in Surabaya for the upper middle class. Some of the international brands are not available in Galaxy Mall, but available in Tunjungan Plaza (such as Coach, MK, Kate Spade, Furla, H&M, Uniqlo, Tory Burch, etc) /Pakuwon Mall (such as H&M, Uniqlo, Bershka, etc).

I'm waiting for Galaxy Mall 3. Hopefully the other famous brands that do not exist in Surabaya and haven't been elsewhere will open at GM3.

High end mall

If you are looking for branded stuff, must go here. It is a modern mall which have many branded stores inside. They also have food court. But little bit pricey. For me, go here for window shopping is good idea
