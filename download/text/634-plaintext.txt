One-stop resto to explore Surabaya's cuisine

There are many culinary spots scattered all around Surabaya you won't have enough time to taste it all... But you must. This is where this place is offering, a complete Surabaya's adventurous culinary experience. The taste is average compare to the food's authentic spot, but hey you don't have time to visit all culinary spots, do you?

Great variety of local foods all in one place

We can find almost all Surabaya local food here, with reasonable price. Great place to hang out with friends, or treat my guests to some local delicacies without having to worry about cleanliness or quality of local food. My favorites are pork ham fried rice and fried ox tongue with 'sambal pencit' (mango chilli). Soto, Rawon, Nasi Campur, Tahu Tek etc can be found here.
