Recommended for community event!

Do not expect British cuisine if you come here. London is only its branding of the interior & decoration. I come here to organize a community meetup. They're really helpful to provide projector, screen, and even microphone. And turns out, they offer bonus for community...event! We got 3 pizzas for free. :D The staff was also friendly & helpful. Overall, it was a great experience.More

Cool Ambiance, Recommended for British Decors Fans

As it's a British-themed cafe, we expected those GB flags, red telephone booth, The Beatles photos, Big Ben and London Eye posters.. And Stilrod provided all of them! Food choice was vary (even though the taste was not that special) and worth the price; they...had UNO cards and it made me and my friends leave quite late. Overall if you're the ones who fancy all the Britsh-y stuffs, I recommend you to come here and snap some good pictures out of this place.More

Not to Surabaya , If Not Yet to Stilrod Cafe

Who does not know with Surabaya ? 2nd metropolitan city after the capital city of Jakarta . Inevitably , a wide range of modern and sophisticated facility available . As an industrial city , education , culture , education and tourism , Surabaya experiencing tremendous...growth rapidly. Therefore , Tri Rismaharini , as the mayor has always stressed the importance of urban development is accompanied by human mental development . It was merely to balance the governance of urban development being promoted . Surabaya travel that had not been so well explored , seems to have appeared geliatnya last 5 years. The new tourist objects and attractions of the old town with its historic old building began ogled by local and foreign tourists . Likewise, a culinary tour that began to bloom in various corners of the city , to the shopping centers and offices . Various theme carried by a typical restaurant , the restaurant or the cafe. Ranging from traditional / ethnicity to the themes of slang , typical of young people . But not many places serving culinary specialties theme or a particular country . We can find the place most in certain areas , for example the typical cuisine of Arab / Middle East region Ampel . Chinese specialties at the malls or certain housing . But only one restaurant with a distinctive taste plus a nuanced British Authentic . Stilrod Cafe with the concept of London / England present a complete dish. Bevereges menu and food menu, display interior and exterior decoration and very British atmosphere as we enter nuances make 'another world'. This sensation will certainly be felt by those who first present here. Interior furniture with materials typical of London in the form of wood and iron. Including a car or telephone original box specially imported from England. Not to forget, the British flag that became icons in various sizes can be encountered. Of course this is not surprising because the owner of this cafe cafe fixation with London or the British really. With the concept of 'We'll Bring You England', the atmosphere and the breath of London were quiet and comfortable it will feel. Trinkets so that the interior was made according to the theme that is coveted by the owner. This cafe, originally was a cycle shop. But in mid 2012 to develop itself into two business units. Stilrod with business store cafe and bloody adaptation of cycle shop. Bloody store that offers merchandise and apparel. While Stilrod Cafe seeded that offer food and beverage services. With a wide choice of angles , the customer can select a preferred. Corner option is of course to spoil the ' mate ' . It is a term familiar to the visitors Stilrod Cafe . So if you are accosted by the waiter or waitress with the greeting , "Hi , Mate ... . " Do not trigger you stare . Because that's the name familiar to you . Quite unique is not it? Pre-wedding photos are often held here . Enough contact to Stilrod management , you will be directly connected with the services of pre - wed . Incidentally , this service also handled by the management Stilrod . So no need to be confused anymore seek the services of a pre -wedding photo maker . There are 48 kinds of food and 59 kinds of drinks are ready to be served . Quite a lot is not it? This course will pamper us . With a variety of menu alternatives in accordance with the ' will ' of our tongue . But remember , the typical British dish remains a trademark know. So , who are accustomed to eating Rujak Cingur or Pecel Lontong , there's nothing wrong with a dish adjust Stilrod Cafe . Let 's start with an alternative choice in the evening aperitif Stilrod Cafe . 59 kinds of drinks is certainly not a small amount . Therefore there are several recommendations made by the bartender. Among very decent for the mates try is as below. Of course , this is also not set in stone , you know . Because your choice will certainly not the same as the bartender choice [check my picts, please.] Coffe Latte served in different variants are: cappucinno , Coffee Latte , Flavoured Coffee Latte , Mocha Machiato , Machiato Caramel , Vanilla Affogato and Long Black . All can be served hot or cold . Except for Vanilla Affogato served cold . Each menu has a different taste . However, the distinctive aroma of espresso mixing Stilrod Cafe will be felt . Especially for the hobbyist espresso . For mates who used to eat with a mini size, you should invite your friends. Three pieces of meat sausage with different materials. Coupled with soft roller potatoes plus special sauce managed to make me shaking his head. Sausage consists of materials chicken, veal and beef that has been marinated in a special material. Each has its suppleness and softness tersndiri. But secured, everything will seem so tempting tongue. Of course it would not be wrong. Ingredients beef / veal is imported from Australia. This is to meet the standards of the current maturity level in the fuel under certain conditions. Local meat can only meet a level of maturity. While imported beef can be burned with 3 kinds of levels of maturity. Customizing the menu that will be served. Well, very unfocused instead? It's only for a choice of meat. Not to mention for other complementary ingredients and seasonings. Some of them also have to be imported from outside, including the original imported from England. 'Stilrod British Pizza' so a typical Italian cuisine took the name presented. There are several variants of typical Italian cuisine. In Stilrod Cafe called Italian Cuisine. Consists of 8 kinds. But the pizza is recommended by the chef. Well, why not try this pizza? With nearly square shape is different from Italian pizza. Italian pizza is usually served with a round shape. Likewise, in terms of thickness. Pizza British Stilrod Cafe has a shape that is thin enough. Unlike the Italian pizza is thick. The level of dryness is also different. On the outer side, feels so dry. It will feel 'weird'. But it will not feel strange if you know that this is a uniqueness. Although dry, being part that feels different when combined central part is smooth and soft. The mates also could try another kind, you know. There Garlic Pizza, Margherita, Tuscany, Stagioni, Formaggi and others. Shapes, flavors, colors will certainly influence the choice of mates. Various variants are created them is to spoil our tongue. If we do not interest with that one, there are many other options. Scotch Egg . A plate with 4 grains ' Scotch Egg ' feels unworthy if called snack . If called snacks for Caucasians mate is probably reasonable . A ' Scotch Egg ' alone makes us intoxicated . Basic ingredients boiled eggs plus bacon wrapped plus secret ingredients creates an incredible taste . Then these snacks are very worthy of being ' Trending menu of Septembre ' . Not without reason , you know . I 've tasted it . This rustic tongue instantly fell in love with ' Scotch Egg ' on the first chew . I continued on to the second grain was more tempting . Until I imagine , if I try to bring my wife . Dividing the incomparable taste sensation . Hehehe .... To further explore ' Scotch Egg ' , I will make a separate article , yes . Let more curious of course .More

Great atmosphere, but don't come here for the food

I read about this place in a magazine, lured in by promises of British food. Imagine my bewilderment when only one item on the menu is remotely British: bangers and mash. When you advertise "authentic London food", please, please stick to it. I don't like...getting lied to. Researching British cuisine isn't going to take up more time than opening a restaurant, really. Everything on the menu reeks of Italian cuisine, from pizza to pasta to the main courses. No, putting a dollop of mashed potatoes next to a piece of meat does not make it British. No, putting "bloody" in every other menu item does not make it British. No, fish and chips isn't breaded; please batter the fish. Yes, I like my calamari rings piping hot, not cold in the center, thank you very much. No, I don't like my soda flat. And one thing has been bugging me since my visit: are they using instant mashed potatoes?! I tasted a strange bitterness in my food, a strange yet familiar bitterness. If my memory serves me right, the bitterness is identical to a brand of instant mashed potatoes I sampled a few months ago. I don't mind waiting a few minutes for you to boil some potatoes. I don't mind eating reheated mashed potatoes made in the morning. But instant mashed potatoes, really? Shame on you. When I'm paying 80k for a dish I don't want cheap instant food. For that matter, I am curious if the "creme brulee" is just instant custard powder? Obviously they don't use cream. The dessert isn't as creamy as it should be due to the low fat content. Obviously, the food here is terrible. Come here only for the atmosphere, perhaps to drink with friends. It is quite cozy.More

Heavily Decorated, Highly Overpriced

I wanted to try this place because I saw pictures of my friends hanging out over there, all over the socmed. I came at 4PM. I didn't bring cash so i asked the waiter who greeted me if i could use my BCA card. She...couldn't understand my question and I repeated. She hesitated, then get her captain/spv to talk to me. (minus point no.1) The Spv told me that they don't accept my card. So i went to the ATM then back to stilrod, ready to order. I was startled looking at the drink price. It costs IDR40.000++ for a glass of iced chocolate! and not many were cheaper, as far as i remembered. For an independent-non-mall-cafe in Surabaya, that was unnecessarily expensive. (minus point no.2) Aside from the poor service and the overly priced drinks, this place is heavily decorated. You can find vintage car, british phone booth in red, and british-like park bench. Great spot for a british pre-wedding theme photoshoot in Surabaya. I would certainly not come back there again.More
