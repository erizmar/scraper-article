The Neighbors Cafe in Surabaya

Cafés are places where people go to drink or eat light food, such as desserts. However, there are many other things you can do other than fill your stomach with delightful food.

You can invite your friends to hang out at a café, or spend your time there to study, and you can also do other indoor activities that the café allows, like playing board games. In Surabaya, there are many cafés. These cafés have different kinds of food; some cafés serve main courses like fried rice, while some cafés don’t. But either way, all cafés have their unique design and food options. This article will share with you the top 5 unique and cool cafés in Surabaya!

1. Kuppel Biergarten and Bar

Enjoy a great night with your friends in Kuppel Biergarten and Bar. In this café, you can watch the starry night from a glass dome, or you can watch the view of the blue sky in the morning! In this galactic café, you can drink with your friends under the star-filled night with lively music piping in the background and dance the night away! Put down your gadgets though, this is not the place to be anti-social! With DJs on the decks and nightly bands in the café, everyone can socialise and enjoy the night.
