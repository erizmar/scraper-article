FANTASTIC BREAKFAST

They have a good spread of local and international buffet, open as early as 6.30 am you either can eat inside or outside the café. Worth the money.

Great Place to Watch EPL Football

Surabaya proved a difficult place to find EPL action on. Thankfully my receptionist recommended SUTOS, there are places to watch and drink coffee, but if you want a cold beer and a lively atmosphere I can recommend TS Cafe. I arrived alone, so I sat...at the bar and easily struck up a conversation with the friendly barman, Teddy. I can also recommend the Tex-mex burger.More

Too much local food

This is the venue of the breakfast area for TS Suites. Food is average and the breakfast served is too heavy for breakfast. Too much rice/noodles are being served and the focus is too much on the local food. Having more varieties on its breakfast...menu will help attract more international travellers to its door for sureMore
