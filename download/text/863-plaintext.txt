Shopping
Galaxy mall is spread over 3 outlets. 1 and 2 are linked and 3 is across the road. It is a very spacious mall with high roofs. It gives a great feeling to be there. Mall 3 has many unoccupied places. Mall 2 has latest brands.

Superb
A must visit mall in Surabaya town. It has a nice ambience, few places to hangout, and a lot of good foods. A little bit pricey, I think its class is equals to Plaza Indonesia (Jakarta)
