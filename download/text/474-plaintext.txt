Cafes, Globetrotting, Indonesia

The growing list of Surabaya cafes

Posted by jooeyjunior on August 24, 2017August 25, 2017

Coffee addict on the loose. Bringing you an ever-growing list of cafes in Surabaya.

6. Gather Inc
https://joojourneys.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/joojourneys_gatherinc_interior_topview.jpgThis spacious and light-filled bistro is a joy to be in, and as the name suggests, it‚Äôs a good gathering place. It also has created nalu bowls( 65K to 70K IDR), which the bistro termed as healthy bowls. Totally enjoyed the creation especially this summer themed one with pink dragonfruit mash, perfect to fight the heat! https://joojourneys.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/joojourneys_gatherinc_interior_counter.jpg https://joojourneys.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/joojourneys_gatherinc_healthy_bowl.jpg

Spent: 120K per person
Address: Jalan Taman Puspa Raya Blok A2 No. 11, Made, Sambikerep, Made, Sambikerep, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60217

5.The Goods Diner[Processed with VSCO with c1 preset]
A photogenic diner / bistro/ cafe located at Jalan Bali. I loved both the indoor and outdoor spaces, which are great for group gatherings. If you need some retail therapy, check out The Goods Dept with local Indonesian designers, just located at the entrance of the diner. [Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]Food was good too (or perhaps I was too hungry as a friend found the food mediocre). [Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]I had Angel hair pasta with prawns, which was slightly spicy, flavourful and enjoyable. [Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]The rainbow mille crepe was pleasing to the eyes, but less so on the tongue. I would probably try other cakes on my next visit.

Spent: 150K ‚Äì 200K IDR per pax
Address: Jl. Bali No.19, Gubeng, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60281

4. Common Grounds (Surabaya)Hipster cafe located in the Pakuwon mall, why not? It‚Äôs a convenient place to get your coffee fix if you are in the area. [Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]
Welcomed by friendly service staff and an open concept food coffee counter.
[Processed with VSCO with f2 preset][Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]They ran out of cold brew and offered me cold white instead which was smooth and easy to like. I had grilled chicken with truffled mash and roasted vegetables. The chicken was roasted nicely, but some parts were a little charred.

The Aglio Olio with mushrooms was a delight to have. The heat was just right, and the portion was good for lunch. Throw in some poached eggs and smoked salmon to get a wholesome post-swim meal. https://joojourneys.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/joojourneys_commongrounds_hamburg_steak_truffle_mash.jpg

The hamburg steak paired with truffled mash was a flavourful and satisfying combination, which I preferred over the grilled chicken.

Spent: 150K IDR per pax.
Address: Jl. Raya Lontar No.5, Lontar, Sambikerep, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60216

3. KudosStandalone building, with level 1 being the retail area, level 2 & 3 as cafe space. [Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]Scandinavian feel in the cafe is strong, coupled with sunlight streaming in, all the pictures turned out nice. Sum it up, pretty place for IGers, with an affordable price tag for food.

[Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]I ate Aglio Olio with shrimps. He had Spicy Abon Cakalang macaroni (elbow pasta).
We shared a Kudos seafood salad, which had a very refreshing dressing made of lemon vinaigrette. Surabaya is a huge exporter of seafood, but unfortunately the seafood in these dishes were rather non-existent.

[Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]I had an ice latte. We shared Matcha Mousse and Oreo Choc Cake, they looked pretty but the taste did not wow us.

Spent: 120 ‚Äì 150K IDR per pax
Address: Jalan Boulevard Indah,, Darmo, Wonokromo, Lidah Wetan, Surabaya, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60213

2. Cura by Threeosix

A lucky find after the original soft serve cafe that we wanted to check out was gone for good. The cafe is nestled in the corner of Green Grocer Supermarket. [joojourneys_surabaya_cura_kitchen]

I got the chicken leg chop (bottom left) with mashed potato and fresh lettuce. Chicken was cooked to perfection, the sauce was pretty sweet. Indonesians like their savoury food with a dash of sugar. [Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]He got the beef brisket (top left) ‚Äì flavour was pretty sweet, and the portion‚Äôs a little small. We shared the handcut fries (shoe string fries).

[Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]I had ice brew tea during lunch so I will be back to try the coffee. We had brownie with coffee ice-cream (sorry, not in the menu too). As we wanted ice-cream to go with the brownies that they baked in the cafe but wasn‚Äôt on the menu, but the kind folks at Cura acceded to our request at no extra charge!

Spent: 120K IDR per pax
Address: Jalan Raya Kupang Indah No. 7, Dukuh Kupang, Dukuh Pakis, Surabaya City, East Java 60225

1. Kabinet Coffee

[joojourneys_surabaya_kabinet_coffee_level1]Located along the same stretch as Kudos. Level 1 housed the roasted coffee beans gallery.
On level 2 you find the cafe, decorated in a black and yellow theme.

[Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]I asked the barista so what goes into the black latte? Charcoal and latte. Fine.
Another trendy drink I guess üòÄ

[Processed with VSCO with f2 preset]Carrot Cake was dense but not too sweet. It was kinda dry after a while, so best to pair it with your drink instead.

You can have a variety of fried snacks here, or some salad and main courses (pasta etc) too.

Spent: 66K IDR
Address: Pakuwon Square AK 2 No.26, Jl. Yono Soewoyo, Lidah Wetan, Lakarsantri, Kota SBY, DKI Jakarta 60213

Many more cuppas to go‚Ä¶
