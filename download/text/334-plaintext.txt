Written by Sahiri Loing

As a business-oriented metropolitan that is sometimes hotter than Jakarta, Surabaya may not be a city that attracts lots of tourists — most people see it as a transit destination on their way to scenic sites such as Mount Bromo.

And like in most big cities, Surabaya is also teeming with hip cafes perfect for weekend hangouts and chit-chat with your besties, not to mention satiating your hunger for all things gastronomical.

So here’s 13 cool cafes you should visit the next time you’re in Surabaya, where the food and coffee’s awesome, and at affordable prices too — our favourite kind of places!

1. Dine under the galaxy: Kuppel Biergarten & Bar

Enclosed in a ceiling-to-floor glass dome, this galactic cafe-bar will remind you of a multi-faceted diamond globe, only that you are dining in it.

This explains its name, Kuppel, which means “dome” in German.

Don’t the suspended lamps resemble the stars and planets in the galaxy?

Photo via bendottetapsemangat

In the day, you can watch the clouds float by under the azure blue sky as you dig into your lunch, and as dusk falls, the lights above will bask you in blue and red, as you get ready to chill the night away with your buddies and beer.

If this is not magical enough, we challenge you to test your limits by downing a rack full of strangely-coloured liquid named Ultraviolet. Or the thick turquoise Tosca soju!

You’ll be serenaded by live bands and DJ spins, so get ready to get high and enjoy some relaxing good time with your friends!

2. Afternoon tea with Teddy bears at One Pose Café

You’ll almost think you just walked into a doll’s house. Or rather, a Teddy bear’s home.

With a Teddy bear theme and everything sweet, cute and pretty, ladies will love this hang out spot.

Photo via xnindyx,-fillyafrn

Comfortably nestled in a housing complex, the façade of One Pose Café looks just like a huge, classically-designed house, with a matching interior that can only be described as elegantly cute.

Photo via foto fun, ratuassakinah elsa

Photo via lindarzki, kurniafungfatmala

The cuisine is a fusion of Western and Asian, with creative names such World Tour in a Plate (Rp.42,00p) – a delicious risotto with breaded chicken and spicy Padang sauce, or the Red Army on Yellow Boat (Rp.25,000) – garlic bread with dabu-dabu topping!

Pair this with a drink from the Healthy Choice menu, and you’ve got an interesting brunch for the day. We recommend Green Pasture (Rp.25,000), a blend of Broccoli, honey, and orange.

Photo via silviichan

It’s time for a girls’ night out!

3. Britain’s Best at Stilrod Café Surabaya

If your tastebuds veer towards the land of James Bond, you should check out Stilrod Café Surabaya.

Photo via gegfia

Everything British is evident in every corner of Stilrod, from the Union Jack wall décor to the iconic red phone booth (which actually works) to the display of a Ford Angia car (think Ron Weasley’s car in ‘Harry Potter’).

Photo via khalidayahya, lourenmichael

Photo via fahmi jazuli, ratnadewiiswulandari

How about the food? You’ll love the nicely textured Creamy Crunch Scots Egg (Rp.24,900), a boiled egg wrapped in smoked beef and delicious sauce. Or the succulent London Steak (Rp.99,900) and the authentic British dish – Bangers and Mash (Rp.54,900) – which will satisfy all you sausage fans.

Photo via kulinersby

And here’s a little titbit about the cafe’s history: Stilrod began as a bicycle shop, but the owner’s love for all things English encouraged him to transform the place into the British-themed Stilrod today.

Photo via firdatraveldiary

“We’ll Bring You England,” they said. And indeed they have.

Stilrod Cafe Surabaya

Address: Jl. Juwono No.2, Darmo, Wonokromo
Contact: +62 31 5683336
Opening Hours: Mon – Sun, 12.00 – 00.00
Price: Rp.15,000 – 100,000 (approximately USD 1.20 – USD 8).

Website

4. Stay Up Late at Domicile Kitchen & Lounge

If you are looking to dine with a bit more sophistication, head on to Domicile Kitchen & Lounge, which has spacious indoor and outdoor areas, and a VIP room for a private meeting with clients.

Photo via charlestunge, jessicangelaa

Domicile offers a variety of cuisine, from Western to Chinese to Indonesian, and their fritter choices (especially the dory and calamari) are deliciously crunchy without overpowering the original seafood taste.

You should try the Wagyu Cheese Burger (Rp.65,000) or Pizza Quatro Formagi (Rp.80,000) which is served with four types of melted cheese!

What’s even greater is that you can stay here till late night. Their fine selection of wine, beer and cocktails will keep you buzzing throughout.

Photo via Dalila Harifah

Domicile Kitchen Lounge

Address: Jl. Sumatra No. 35, Gubeng.
Contact: +62 31 5016900

Price: Rp.35,000 – 350,000 (approximately USD 2.45 – 24.50)

Website

5. Coffee and Satay at Cailano Specialty Coffee & ShaoKao

Have you ever tried enjoying your favourite cup of coffee with satay?

Well, realistically speaking, we wouldn’t really recommend pairing them (maybe order the coffee after), but Cailano Specialty Coffee & ShaoKao, which is adorned with minimalistic and all-white decor, offers you that option.

‘Shaokao’ is a Chinese street food similar to Indonesia’s satay, as it’s spiced (minus the coconut sauce), skewered, and grilled.

Photo Via Ifan_rosandy

Photo via Zonaweiwei

Cailano’s Super Mangkok (Rp.39,000) is quite tasty – it comes with a simple dish of rice, shaokao, grilled beef or chicken, and edamame. Or you can order individual shaokao (chicken or beef) – we totally recommend the Cheesy Beef Bomb (Rp.13,000).

Photo Via Irawanhardjo, Apriliaaditisar, Immanuel_nico

After your tummy is filled, head off to the coffee bar to order some delicious coffee, such as cappuccino (using Brazilian beans) brewed with the La Marzocco Linea machine. If you prefer the manual brew, try the citrusy Bali Plaga coffee which is concocted with the Kalita brewing method.

Cailano Specialty Coffee & ShaoKao

Address: Jl. Klampis Jaya No.43, Kompleks Ruko Milenia, Surabaya
Contact: +6231 822 3299 0019
Opening Hours: Mon – Sat, 08.00 – 23.00; Sunday, 10.00 – 23.00
Price: Rp.13,000 – 39,000 (approximately USD 1.04 – 3.12)

Website

6. That Quant Vintage Cafe: Grandfather Coffee Shop

True to its name, the interior of Grandfather Coffee Shop is soooo vintage. An old vespa here and an old-timey teak-wood cabinet there and — voila! — you’ve snared an Instagrammable spot!

Photo via agoes dhooey

Photo via alamjo

You can find local cuisine with some Western options here, and it’s satisfying on the comfort food front that definitely won’t break the bank.

Photo via bendottetapsemangat,-ndreandree

If you’re going for the main menu, we recommend the Medallion Beef (Rp.65,000), and for coffee (or the Cream Miscelato) you’ll be given the choice of adding chips or jelly (Rp.26,000 to 28,000).

Photo via snapfoodsurabaya,-dewinuralfiana

In fact, Grandfather Coffee Shop is going so old-school vintage, that it uses a fan indoors (they have a wider outdoor area), so be warned against cigarette fumes.

There’s a live band performing here on some evenings – where better to catch up with your buddies and reminisce about the old times than at this vintage cafe with some beer and music?

Photo via rezarosiadi

Grandfather Coffee Shop

Address: Jl. Kalasan No.25i, Surabaya
Contact: +62 822232053222
Opening Hours: Mon – Sun, 12.00 – 00.00
Price: Rp.15,000 – 65,000 (approximately USD 1.20 – 5.20).

Website

7. Guilty Pleasures Galore at Yoohoo Desserts and Bites

This place is clearly designed for those with a sweet tooth, where your bowl or toast will be deliciously filled with generous scoops of ice-cream.

Yoohoo Desserts and Bites serves up savoury bites for lunch and dinner too, but we know you aren’t here for a proper meal.

Photo via bendottetapsemangat

Recommended on our list is the Mochi Toast or the YooHoo Dessert Oreo Ball (Rp.45,000), a heavenly assortment of colourful sweets that includes taro, red beans, egg pudding, pearl jellies, green tea ice cream, and oreos (the pink ones)! You can opt for either the complete serving or a smaller one.

If you’re craving for something creamier, we suggest the Gimmesmores Parfait, a jug stacked with vanilla and chocolate ice-cream, chocolate pillow snack, topped with chocolate bars, Pocky sticks, marshmallows, choco cookies, and waffles.

Photo via christamartina, syafiumam, veldamasli, liviawinardi

Are you hungry for dessert now?

Yoohoo Desserts and Bites

Address: Ruko Taman Gapura, G Walk Citraland, Jl. Niaga Gapura No.14,
Contact: +62 31 7421882
Opening Hours: Mon – Sun, 11.00 – 23.00
Price: Rp.12,000 – 35,000 (approximately USD 1.04 – 2.80).

Website

8. Enter the birdcages: Noach Café & Bistro

Noach Café & Bistro is another pretty cafe, with a bit of a masculine touch, due to its solid wood coverings, grey tiles, black pendant frame lamps, and a bit of green thrown into the mix in the form of faux plants.

But it also comes with plush comfy sofas and birdcage seats that ladies would love to Instagram at.

Photo via annisapanca,-jesseca.jeannie

Photo via gregory.evan22,-andrewutomo

The ambience of the two-storey Noach is more of a restaurant than a café, but the prices are pretty much in the affordable range.

Photo via la2gig

Their recommended items include Mexican Tacoz (soft corn tortilla filled with lettuce, chilli con carne, salsa and guacamole) and Spaghetti Aglio Olio (topped with bacon, parmesan and cheese tuile).

And can you resist these cheesy Crispy Spinach balls?

Don’t forget to order a refreshing Lemongrass Cooler or Maple Mojito to quench your thirst on a hot afternoon, and end your meal with the delicious Noach Pancake topped with strawberries and ice-cream!

Photo via eonnifood,-shantiambardi,-diazaro

Noach Cafe & Bistro

Address: Jl. Pregolan No.4, Tegalsari, Surabaya
Contact: +62 31 5311360
Opening Hours: Mon – Thurs, 11.00 – 00.00, Fri – Sat, 11.00 – 02.00
Price: Rp.33,000 – 199,000 (approximately USD 2.64 – 15.92).

9. Of flowers and romance: ONNI Kitchen

As you enter ONNI Kitchen, only one word is apt enough to describe its ambience – whimsical.

The backyard-kitchen restaurant has such sweet and woody decor, it’s perfect for a girls’ night out.

Photo via freddy.rahardjo

ONNI infused a very pretty touch to the table set-up, which includes fresh flowers and a personalised menu card with your name printed on it, if you are there for a special occasion and made reservations beforehand.

On the fixed menu set (salad, appetizer, main entrée, dessert), we love the Lemon Butter Dory (Rp.220,000) and the Wagyu Yakiniku (Rp.275,000), and we recommend the delectable Espresso Panna Cotta for dessert. Do make reservations beforehand, as the cafe can only accommodate up to 30 people.

If you fall in love with their cute props and decor, you can actually purchase some at their ONNI Store, which sells fresh flowers too!

Photo via jessicajessie, Devia Anggita

And if you are looking for a cute place to take the little ones to, ONNI organises family activities on some weekends, with lots of games, cooking activities and animal fun the kids will love!

ONNI Kitchen

Address: Jl. Opak No. 56, Darmo, Wonokromo, Surabaya, East Java, 60261.
Contact: +62 31 5630403.
Price: Two fixed menus at Rp. 220,000 (USD 17.60) and Rp.275,000 (USD 22)
Opening Hours: Mon-Sun 10.00 – 22.00

Website

10. Chill and chat over coffee: Black Barn Café

This little ‘barn’ looks pretty hip on the outside and has an industrial feel on the inside.

Photo via jeepseajoey

Here’s the ideal place for some chitchat over coffee, or to chill and linger with a good book or your laptop (WiFi speed is fast!).

Photo via dhiptadi

Photo via pratiwitrya

Try their classic Spaghetti Meatballs, or pick from the menu of the day, which can range from Soto Mie Jekardah to Poffertjes. And finish up with a warm coffee or a fancier red velvet latte!

Photo via hendrochi, rizki jabrik, gogo asri

Black Barn Cafe

Address: Jl. Untung Suropati No.79, Tegalsari.
Contact: +62 31 5671066
Opening Hours: Mon – Thursday, 11.00 – 22.30, Fri – Sun, 11.00 – 23.30
Price: Rp.20,000 – 40,000 (approximately USD 1.60 – 3.20)

Website

11. Authentic traditional local food: Rumah Makan Kano

For an authentic local taste, you can find Indonesian street food served in cosy and vintage surroundings at Kano (acronym for Kabeh Ono, which means “we have everything” in Javanese).

Photo via josephkartawinyoto

Photo via tirzaalvina1303

Photo via irwantan

You can get your familiar and delicious Indonesian fare here, such as fried chicken served with an ultra spicy sambal (Rp.18,00p), Balinese Ayam Betutu (Rp.30,000) or Sundanese Nasi Empal Kribo (Rp.30,000), a sweet, spiced beef shredded on top of rice in way that makes it look like an afro or kribo.

Photo via timothy.cy,-amandakohar

We suggest ordering some Aloe Vera Juice (Rp.15,000) to go with your meal, considering that you will probably have to relieve your tongue from the red-hot sambal!

Kano

Address: Jl. HR. Moh. No.92, Pradahkalikendal, Dukuh Pakis, Kota Surabaya, Jawa Timur 60226, Indonesia
Contact: +62 31 7343606
Opening Hours: Mon – Sun, 08.00 – 22.00
Price: Rp.15,000 – 80,000 (approximately USD 1.20 – 6.40).

Website

12. Soak up the sun: The Localist Coffee and Bistro Surabaya

Don’t we all love sleek, spacious cafes where the sunlight streams in and brightens up the entire room?

Photo via richard.budiman, jessicaevelinee

At The Localist Coffee and Bistro Surabaya, with majestic floor-to-ceiling glass windows, you’ll get exactly that.

Photo via veronicaadelyne

The coffee has all your usual suspects, but we love the mocktail names, such as ‘Daun di Atas Bantal’ (leave on a pillow) or ‘Mantan Terindah’ (the most beautiful ex-lover), which are actually titles of Indonesian films.

Photo via jejaringmakanan

Food here is a variety of Western and Chinese, such as Mini Burger with Fries and Fried Beef Kwetiaw. And they are all pretty affordable!

Photo via sasmitaedo, jejaringmakanan, waregcok, chrisla

Again, we love the huge space you get at The Localist, helped no doubt by the natural light. Avoid the midday sun though, as it can be too warm and blinding if you are facing the sun.

But the beautiful orange glow is lovely in the evenings!

The Localist Coffee and Bistro Surabaya

Address: Jl. Arief Rahman Hakim 40, Surabaya, Indonesia 60000
Contact: +62 31 5937373
Opening Hours: Daily 0800 – 2200
Price: Rp.20,000 – 45,000 (approximately USD 1.60 – 3.60).

13. Have a sea-riously yummy lunch – Dream of Kahyangan Art Resto

Have a scrumptious lunch at this eccentric fusion restaurant located in the heart of the city! The uniqueness of this restaurant shines through from their Chinese-Javanese inspired interior, making your lunch here a mindblowing tastebud and cultural experience.

Make sure you try their well-known seafood dishes, such as the Sate Kamasutra, a squid and shrimp skewer coated with their special sauce, or Gurami Pesona Sangkuriang, fresh local fish cooked in sour gravy.
