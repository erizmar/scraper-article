Terrible beyond comprehension

Visited this place based on reviews that mentioned Kudos was worth to visit. Decor : It does looked cool from the front, but i don’t understand whether the decor was suppose to be tropical or rustic. It end up looking cluttered. Such a shame, pick...a theme and stick with it. Coffee: I can only order espresso, because apparently milk allergy wasn’t a consideration so they don’t serve anything other than regular milk. No soy. No almond. No selection. But the espresso was fine. Food: The highlight of the visit was the food. It was unbelievably bad beyond belief. We took a long time trying to decide what to eat, the description of the menu was a mix of Indonesian and English. I end up ordering beef and mushroom “rendang” they said. It was what appear to be minced beef with tiny bits of mushroom drenched in oil and made into a rather horrific shape. See attached for picture. Suffice to say, won’t recommend and wont be coming back.More

Humble Coffee Shop

A down to earth and humble decorated cafe has a good selection of coffee and other beverages (orange tea which I really like), also provide a various of tasty Asian fusion dishes, really complete the ambiance. The service is awesome, sometimes the owner greet customers,...work efficiently, and the most important is they have a wise price. Other facilities such free wifi, parking area, toilets, are all available. Really such a great place to spend with family, friends, or even alone looking for an idea.More
