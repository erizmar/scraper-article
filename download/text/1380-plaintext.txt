Not something to go out of your way for
It's fine to take a small boat ride, you'll see a few birds. But you will also see a lot of plastic and few other animals. This is a teaching destination for about Indonesian students and educators and families to enjoy. Tourists traveling an hour out of their way will be left wanting.…

So so.
A polite 'average' rated 'walk in the park', surrounded by mangroves. Quite a few young couples holding hands and taking selfies, not many tourists. Fine if you're in the area, but a long drive from the cruise ship terminal.

Great experience, nice to visit
Great experience to visit this place, we can walk and go with the boat to see mangrove ecosystem. We can see also animals of this ecosystem. Sadly, we can see that municipal waste come with the water flow and pollute this ecosystem..

Short December Visit to Surabaya
Had an opportunity to see the conservation work and walk through the Mangrove Forest. Sadly, I didn't have my SLR Camera so my iPhone had to suffice! Good place to walk and take pictures, and spend a few hours exploring this eco conservation area.

Fun day trip to escape the city
If you are looking for a day trip to escape the city, the mangroves are a nice option. You can take a walk on a boardwalk type walkway above the mangroves for 5,000 IDR per person (less than 50 cents US). Pay attention to the area where the mangroves meet the water...the crabs are stealthy, but there are a ton of them. There are no railings on the walkway, so we careful if you bring little ones. The walkways are in the shade. Note- when you arrive in the parking lot, follow the sign for "jogging trail" to get to this part. The free part near the parking lot has little shade and, in general, is not as pretty. Another option if you are feeling adventurous is to take a boat ride (25,000 IDR adults, 15,000 IDR children) to one of the large bali style huts located near the open sea. The…
