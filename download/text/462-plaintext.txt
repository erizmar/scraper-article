Just OK!

Atmosphere is good, with friendly waiters/waitresses. A fine selection of coffees but overpriced compared to Dunkin' Donuts, which has a better selection of pastries and bigger coffee cups.

Comfortable Coffee and Snacking Places

The location of this cafe is near Gubeng Surabaya. At the corner. Here you can drink and snack light snacks. Our family's favorite snack is chicken bitterballen. It's fried cake which is round panir flour which contains potatoes and meat or chicken. For coffee you...can order hot or cold. To come here, for those of you who used to smoke there is a place provided (non AC). Don't forget to check the promo before coming here, because for us, credit card promos can save your bills.

Cozy place

I go to Excelso HR Muhammad Surabaya: Cozy place for coffee/tea time. I like the interior, coffee, tea, chocolate, milkshake availble here. Nice place for meeting/gathering with your relative and friends. I used try the avocado coffee, raspberry punch, cappucino, orange juice, and tea. My...fav: avocado coffee and rasberry punch, so fresh and kind of moodbooster your day. The food only snack, pasta, sandwich, fish and chips. No burger and rice. The wifi so weak. They also provide space for office, family, friend gathering in 2d floor. I think fit for 50-60 people. Valley parking Rp. 10K. Price start from 40K up. Friendly staff. Indoor and outdoor area.More

Good food, but stunningly outdated concept of service

A cafe in a mall that still allows people to smoke and disturb everyone else, really??!! I asked for a soda water with lime and the answer was "no". So I asked... Do you have soda? "yes", Do you have a glass? "yes" Do you...have ice? "yes" Do you have fresh lime? "yes" Could I have them together? "no" I should have asked do you have customer service... Finally after much discussion with the managr, the water came back and offered that I could have their expensive soda water and syrup concoction, but separated in two glasses, but because the syrup made up half the glass I could only have have a glass of soda and would have to pay the full price of the drink. $5 for half a glass of cheap water with bubbles... Really?? I don't think soMore

Dark Interior Design

Had lunch here with my wife last week. Come inside the Cafe, first impression, room looks small and dark because there are a lot of pilar inside. Make us feel not really comfort as usually we have at Excelso Cafe. Food and Beverage are Excelso's...standard.More
